# HTML Spacing Style Guide
### Why indent at all? 
The goal of indenting your code is to make it easy to read. Code that is easy to read, is easier to debug. Many amateur developers decide that it's not necessary to worry about things like indentation early on, especially since their HTML pages are simple and bug-free. To them, it doesn't seem necessary. 

However, each time you code, you're building habits. These habits will stick with you, and building improper habits early on just means you'll have to unlearn those habits later, which is harder than just doing it right from the beginning. Plus, it's incredibly annoying to read someone's code who doesn't indent correctly. So if you want other developers to like working with you, **INDENT CORRECTLY!**

### So what are the indentation rules? 
The rules are somewhat flexible, and each developer has his/her own preferences. 
However, there are some hard rules that you must abide by: 

1. Put your opening and closing HTML tags on their own line.
    - Example: 
        ``` HTML
          <p>
            This is a good example of both putting your HTML elements on their own line. 
            Notice that the content inside the HTML element is indented.
            Also take note that the closing tag (</p>) is aligned perfectly with the opening tag (<p>). 
          </p>
        ```
    - Exceptions: 
        * If you are using a paragraph `<p>`, `<li>`, or any header `<h1>, <h2>, ...` tag, and there are very few words inside your element, it's okay to put them on one line. 
            - This is fine: 
              ``` HTML
                <h1>My Website</h1>
              ``` 
            - Bad: 
              ``` HTML
                <p>This is a paragraph containing a lot of text. There is so much text that it can be 
                  confusing to see where the paragraph starts and ends. So it's really best to indent 
                  this like you'll see below.</p>
              ``` 
            - Good:
              ``` HTML
                <p>
                  This is a paragraph containing a lot of text. There is so much text that 
                  it can be confusing to see where the paragraph starts and ends. 
                  But looking at it in this format makes it easy to understand!
                </p>
              ``` 

1. Nested HTML elements should be indented to the right of their "parent" element.
    - Good:
      ``` HTML
        <div id='parent'>
          <p id='child'>
            Note that the paragraph tag is indented once so it is inside both the opening and 
            closing tag of the div. In this scenario, the div is the "parent" element, 
            and the paragraph is the "child" element.
          </p>
        </div>
      ```
    - Bad:
      ``` HTML
        <div id='parent'>
        <p id='child'>
          This text is indented inside the paragraph tag, but the whole paragraph element needs
          to be indented within the div tag. See the "Good" example above for the
          proper indentation.
        </p>
        </div>
      ```
1. Nesting can get a little tricky with multiple layers!
    - Good:
      ``` HTML
        <div id='parent'>
          <h1>Welcome!</h1>
          <p id='child'>
            Look at this beautiful paragraph indentation! It looks like my favorite
            code to read.
          </p>
          <h2>Here is a list!</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>I am a list item with few words!</li>
            <li>
              When a list item is long enough to be split into multiple lines
              the text gets wrapped and indented much like the paragraph tag above, with the
              list item tag indented once within the unordered list tag and the text
              indented once with in the list item tag.
            <li>
            <li>One more list item for good meaure</li>
          <ul>
        </div>
      ```
      - Bad:
        ``` HTML
          <div id='parent'>
            <h1>Welcome!</h1>
          <p id='child'>Look at this sad paragraph indentation :(. It makes my code
            much harder to read</p>
          <h2>This is not indented properly!</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>I am a list item! That needs to be indented!</li>
            <li>When a list item is long enough to be split into multiple lines
            the text should get wrapped and indented like a paragraph tag, with the
            list item tag indented once within the unordered list tag and the text
            indented once with in the list item tag. This is not done properly at all!</li>
            <li>One list item more that needs to be indented!</li>
            <ul>
          </div>
        ```

1. Remember the main objective:Â **make your code readable by others!**
